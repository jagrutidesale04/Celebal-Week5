# Week 5: House Price Prediction – Feature Engineering & Modeling

This project is part of **Week 5** of the **Celebal Summer Internship** program.

The assignment involved building a robust regression pipeline to **predict house prices** using the **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques** dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to perform **data preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection**, and build multiple machine learning models for comparison and final prediction.

##  Features

- Comprehensive Data Preprocessing:
  - Null value handling
  - Feature construction (`TotalSF`, square footage, etc.)
  - One-hot encoding of categorical features
  - Log transformation for skewed target

- Predictive Modeling (Regression):
  - Simple Linear Regression
  - Multiple Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression (Degree 2)
  - Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor (with Grid Search)
  - Support Vector Regressor (with scaling)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor

- Feature Engineering & Selection:
  - `SelectKBest` for top features
  - PCA for dimensionality reduction (50 components)
  - t-SNE for 2D visualization of price clusters

-  Model Evaluation:
  - RMSE, R², MSE for model comparison
  - Final model selection via `GridSearchCV`
